## Description

Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers to unlock a universe of open financial applications. Inka wallet integrates with the Compound service through smart contracts in the Solidity language, which allows you to have easy access to add liquidity to the service.

<p>A smart contract for using the Compound service takes a commission that is charged to the Inka wallet.</p>
